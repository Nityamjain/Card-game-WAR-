# War - Card Game

**War** is a simple and classic card game played with a standard deck of 52 cards. It is typically played by two players, though it can be adapted for more.

## Setup

1. **Deck**: Use a standard 52-card deck. Shuffle the deck thoroughly.
2. **Deal**: Divide the deck evenly between the two players, so each player has 26 cards. Players keep their cards in a face-down stack without looking at them.

## Gameplay

1. **Draw Cards**: Both players simultaneously draw the top card from their stacks and place it face-up in the center.
2. **Compare Cards**: The player with the higher-ranking card wins the round and takes both cards, placing them face-down at the bottom of their stack.
3. **War**: If the two cards are of equal rank, a "war" is declared:
   - Each player places three cards face-down in the center.
   - Both players then draw one more card and place it face-up.
   - The player with the higher-ranking face-up card wins all the cards in the center.
   - If the final face-up cards are also of equal rank, another war is declared, and the process repeats.
4. **Continuing Play**: Players continue drawing, comparing, and collecting cards until one player has all the cards or until an agreed-upon time limit is reached.

## Winning the Game

The game continues until one player has collected all the cards, making them the winner. Alternatively, players can decide to end the game after a set period, with the player holding the most cards at that point declared the winner.

## Variations

There are several variations to make the game more interesting or quicker:
- **Double War**: During a war, players place two face-down cards instead of three.
- **Instant War**: Players immediately place a single face-up card during a war without the three face-down cards.
- **Multi-player War**: More than two players can play by evenly distributing the cards among all participants.

**War** is a game of chance rather than skill, making it suitable for players of all ages and skill levels. The simplicity of its rules allows for easy and quick play, making it a popular choice for casual gaming.
